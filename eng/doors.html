Kod lajsni nema grešaka drveta (čvorovi) nema diskoloracije, a tekstura je slična (friz i polufriz). Takođe nema ni beljike kao ni ogledala (špigla ili blistače).

				<h3>What is needed for quality wooden doors?</h3>
				<p>Benefits of doors made of wood-based materials are numerous. Wood is a natural material that when incorporated and taken into the home provides a great deal of warmth, it is always in fashion, it is ecologically clean material and can be processed into a myriad of shapes and colors. Wood is also a good heat and sound insulator that "breathes" and if well maintained can last for decades and adorns your home.</p>
				<p>Doors can be divided into several categories: front door, interior doors, patio, security, fireretardant... The division is certainly conditioned by the very purpose of the doors and, depending on the application depends materials that will be used in the manufacture. The quality of materials that can be used for making door and defined by specific standards (D.E1.011: D.E1.012 etc.). The materials that are used are also dependent on the purpose and looks of the door. Various types of wood, boards, veneer, laminated wood, plywood can be used.</p>

							Front doors are made of solid wood and can be made in combination with other materials - eg. with glass. Wood used to produce elements of the door must be healthy and free of errors that can significantly reduce the mechanical properties of the door. When we talk about the allowable error, then we can say it's a small obliqueness of the wire, small coalesced nodes, etc. Material from which the doors are made despite the fact that must be of high quality also must be artificially dried to 8% - 10% humidity.<br>
							It is important due to preventing dryness and appearance of grout lines and crevices that during the exploitation. Most commonly are used hardwood (oak, beech, ash and cherry) conifers (fir, spruce and pine) and exotics (mahogany, meranti). Recently, the making the front door and used various types of thermo-treated wood (a temperature of over 185 C -190 C), which has its great benefits about which we will talk more next time.

					For front door frame and plot (wing) are made of solid wood. These doors can be single, double and a half wing. It also can be with or without skylights. Surface treatment is usually done with water-based varnish in at least two layers with mandatory polish between the procedures. Addition wood before painting can be refined and tinted by the desire of investors and adapted to color of interior.
All doors must have shackles: three hinges of various kinds (JUS M.K3.090) at least one lock studs (M.K3.030), a pair of handles (M.K3.050) and buffer.

					Inside the door, depending on the material used in the preparation can be divided into:
				</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Doors out of foil</li>
						<li>Craft master</li>
						<li>MDF</li>
						<li>MDF and veneer</li>
						<li>Solid wood</li>
					</ul>
				<p>
					This time we shall limit ourselves, and tell some more about the interior doors done in a combination of MDF and veneer. Finished door consist of frame (doorcase), plot (wing), stitch strips (trim placed around the door) and fittings. Frame can be done in many ways and we will explain one of them.

					The first is made a panel out of the massif elements from which the errors are removed. Such elements are lengthwise (finger joint) and widthwise merge in order to get a massif panel. Timber from which the panels are made is pre-dried to 8% moisture to to prevent distortion, ridge distortion across the width boards , shrinkage and other errors. The most common types of wood for making these plates are lime, fir and spruce. The plates are then mechanically processed and prepared for the stage of sticking them on MDF 4 mm bilaterally. After that the frame  is profiled, merging indentations in wood are done, edges are rounded and then with all the obtained curves is veneered. Plot (wing) is made so that the substructure of massive lime, fir or spruce sticks to 6 mm MDF with both sides. The reinforcements are placed for the lock that are also made of massive and in the middle cardboard honeycomb.

					Plot obtained like so is coated with noble 0.6 mm veneer. After that is performed formatting, drilling, edging ... Trim placed around the door (stitch molding) are made of 18 mm MDF and 8 mm MDF, which are cut out in strips and then are glued, profiled and refined with veneer. The resulting tuned or swimming trim placed around the door are used to "iron out" the different thickness of the walls, which are often  case in facilities. Surface treatment is done with polyurethane and water-based varnishes and smoothers.

					Tones are unlimited and can also be done without the gloss varnish (matte) or with the specific content of gloss (up to 90% - high gloss). All these materials allow for  doors to be  shaped, designed, and by color and gloss fully fit into the existing interior of each apartment, home or office.
